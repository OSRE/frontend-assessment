# OSRE Front-end assignment note app

This assignment is created to get a good image of your front-end skills. You will be building a simple note app with basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update & Delete actions). Included in this repository you'll find a sketch file with all the desired elements. The way you approach this assignment is all up to you :)

The design is created in Sketch from Bohemian Coding which is only available on Mac OSX. If you don't have Sketch yet, download the app and use the free trial for this assignment.

## The assignment

Create the SPA (Single Page Application) and follow the design closely. Make sure the app is responsive (it also looks good on tablet and mobile devices).

### Functionalities

1. Add notes
2. Show notes
3. Edit note
4. Delete note

### Basic requirements/tips
- Decide for yourself if you want to use a specific framework, and if so, which one you would like to use (Angular, React, VueJS).
- Notes doesn't have to be stored in a real database. Usage of localStorage is also allowed.
- Use Git as version management control and publish the end result in a public repository. Be sure to create comprehensive commit messages!

### Bonus points
- Make use of a pre-processor like Gulp or Webpack
- Make use of Sass (SCSS) in stead of CSS
- To be able to point weaknesses in the UI/UX of the application and to be able to give good fundamental arguments of course ;)
- Usage of typescript
- Enabling Markdown syntax on creating/editing notes
- A lot of bonus points for unit tests that are easy to run
